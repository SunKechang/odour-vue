            '\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0This website is mainly used to search the index database of flavor compounds. The database was established by the research team led by Zhu Baoqing, teacher of Beijing Forestry University. The database covers the basic information of flavor compounds, such as CAS number, chemical structure diagram, aroma threshold and aroma description; At the same time, the research team used GC-Orbitrap-MS to detect the retention index, ionic fragments and relative abundance of flavor compounds, and drew high-resolution mass spectra. The purpose of this website is to establish a platform for sharing information about flavor compounds, and to facilitate the academic research of scholars in related fields.',
            '\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0With the follow-up research, we will constantly update the index database of flavor compounds. Of course, we also welcome you to add relevant information to the database and work with us to supplement and improve the database. If you are willing to add data or put forward valuable suggestions, please contact us, and we will reply to you as soon as possible!'

            introduction:'\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Our research group at Department of Food Science, School of Biology, Beijing Forestry University was established in 2012, and was currently led by Professor Bolin Zhang and Dr. Baoqing Zhu. Our group is focused on research priorities of forestry fruit and fruit wine industry, with the following research interests: (1) Flavor quality evaluation of forestry fruits and their value-added products; (2) Technology of fruit wine production; (3) Application of sensory evaluation method in development and quality control of forest products; (4) Detection of fraud and adulteration for forest fruit products. Currently, there are 2 doctoral students and 14 master students in our research group. Up to now, there are 11 alumnus and more than 100 undergraduates. More than 30 research papers have been published in the above fields, and one national invention patent has been authorized. Our research group has cooperated extensively with domestic and foreign institutions, such as China Agricultural University, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing Technology and Business University, China National Institute of Standardization, and Turku University of Finland, etc. The mission of our group is to provide scientific and technological support that could benefit the development of forestry food industry. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Dr. Baoqing Zhu (email address: zhubaoqing@bjfu.edu.cn).'
